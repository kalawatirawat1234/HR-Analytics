**I'm eager to show my first Power BI dashboardðŸ“Š. This dashboardðŸ“Š, which displays insights from HR data using SQL queriesðŸ“…, represents the pinnacle of my data research journeyðŸ“ˆ. These visualizations reflect the spirit of data-driven decision-making. I've delved into topics like calculating total attrition to analyzing Education attrition, Attrition rate by Gender for different age groups, and Department attrition with each chart showing a query's results. The process of creating this dashboardðŸ“Š and seeing the data come to life visually has been an incredible educational experience. Future dashboards I make will be even more potent as I investigate more challenging data sets. Keep an eye out for more data adventures and more impactful dashboards in the futureðŸŒŸ.**
